#### "There comes a time in a man's life when to get where he has to go -- if there are no doors or windows -- he walks through a wall." -Bernard Malamud

I was born poor and generally disadvantaged, but even as a kid I worked motherf'ing hard. ^_^;;<!--more--> I knew that I was far behind most of my peers in a lot of regards, and that if I wanted to succeed in life, I'd have to work my ass off to keep up with those who had a headstart. 

I taught myself how to read at an early age(3 maybe?) by listening to books on tape and following along with the actual book. In particular, I recall liking the ["Little Golden Books"](http://www.randomhousekids.com/brand/little-golden-books/) series, especially ["The Poky Little Puppy"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Poky_Little_Puppy). I played around with electronics(toys and otherwise) by futzing around with them until I understood why certain things I did lead to certain behaviors.

I learned how computers worked by repeatedly trashing my dad's Epson ActionNote running Windows 3.1 (it looked a lot like [this](http://www.acrpc.net/epson-actionnote-4slc33/)) and untrashing it before he needed to bring it back into work ahaha. ALL I DO IS C:\WIN. C:\WIN NO MATTER WHAT(...unless I want to stay in DOS).

In middle school, I taught myself the basics of programming using a TI-82 by messing around with a game called "Race" (I think it's one of [these](http://www.ticalc.org/pub/82/basic/games/arcade/racing/)), and a lot of random math apps. I wrote a ton of apps and games, some for my teachers to distribute, some for my friends, most of which are now lost. Some remaining artifacts:

   * [Final Fanta](http://www.drunkenarts.com/images/random/ffanta.jpg), a first-person action RPG.
   * I forget what I named this JRPG, but it contained two heroes with the default names [Dan](http://www.drunkenarts.com/images/random/statdan.jpg) and [Amy](http://www.drunkenarts.com/images/random/statamy.jpg).

I've overcome countless incidents of racism and other such discrimination. Living in a cul-de-sac that you could only get to by passing through the projects also helped me to build character and garner a ton of interesting stories ahaha.

There were two notable times in my life where I escaped death. At the very least, both incidents tried to take my ability to walk from me. I persevered. (Side note: the [Jaws of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydraulic_rescue_tools) are incredibly awesome!)

I went through a divorce that, as they often do, took me by surprise. I've mostly recovered but I'm proud of how little I let that affect my life and my relationships.

Yeah, I've walked through my share of walls. At this point, I'm almost certain that [noclipping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noclip_mode) is permanently enabled for me. ^_^;; I attribute most of my success to hard work and dedication to pursuing my goals, pure and simple. The rest is luck, especially with regards to meeting kind-hearted, good people. I've been fortunate enough to encounter so many of those, and I reflect daily on how grateful I am to have them in my life.

So f your walls. I'll be the one leaving Dan-sized holes in them. THAT SOUNDS WRONG BUT YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN. ^_^;;
