#### Just what I needed

Those of you who know me well know that I have all sorts of subscription services. <!--more-->There's the basic Amazon Subscribe and Save stuff, and then Poland Spring's home delivery service of course. But then there's the [Five Four Club](https://www.fivefourclothing.com/new/)(men's indie brand clothing) and [Bespoke Post](https://www.bespokepost.com/)(limited-edition gentleman's lifestyle stuff). Only recently did I finally cancel [Loot Crate](http://www.lootcrate.com/). But then a friend had to go ahead and give me a solid review of [Blue Apron](https://www.blueapron.com/). WHY DO YOU DO SUCH THINGS?! *:: sobs ::*
