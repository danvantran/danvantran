title: MOBAs have finally snared me
---

#### I held out for awhile, but like a siren "Heroes of the Storm" called out for me

It's the perfect mix of strategic thinking, reactive tactical action, and short-format gameplay. Make it stop.<!--more--> The matches average 15-30 minutes, allowing me to play 2-3 matches at a time without feeling like I've thrown away an entire portion of the day. A wide variety of the characters are enjoyable for me to play ([Sylvanas](http://us.battle.net/heroes/en/heroes/sylvanas/) is definitely the one that best matches my play style), and new ones are released often. The importance of dynamically changing your team strategy to not only adapt to each team that you're playing, but also to the specific objectives of the [map](http://us.battle.net/heroes/en/battlegrounds/) of the current game (each map has its own objectives and unique environment) keeps the individual matches unique and interesting. Voice-chatting with friends also makes it hilariously fun. It's been awhile since I had a regular crew of people to call me names. ;p

On one hand, I've quit Twitch.tv. However, I've also added Heroes of the Storm-related podcasts to my queue, so I'm not sure if that's a net win. ^_^;;
