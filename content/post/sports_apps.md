#### I play a *lot* of sports games on my phone

They're surprisingly engaging and equally therapeutic.<!--more--> My current favorites are "Ace Fishing" and "Soccer Spirits". I have yet to spend any [real-life] money on any of these games but I do have a tendency to pay for IAPs/DLC to support developers, and I'm quickly approaching the "okay I've reaped enough enjoyment from this app" threshold on some of them.
