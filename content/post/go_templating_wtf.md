#### ARGLEBERRIES!!

Though to be fair, I'm probably using it wrong.<!--more--> I added taxonomies(tags and categories) to my posts, and then wrote some code to link "related posts" at the bottom of each post entry. The Hugo devs are apparently going to add "Intelligently Related Posts" in the future, but I figured that I could add something myself. It was a **lot** more painful than it should have been. ^_^;; I'm looking forward to returning to Ember.js and those sorts of frameworks.
