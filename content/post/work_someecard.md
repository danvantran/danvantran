I teach my team this lesson all the time, except it's usually along the lines of:

*When you're stressing out about work, take a step back and realize that when you finish your current workload and priorities, there's always another workload and set of priorities right behind it. It doesn't end... **and then you die.** Stressing out about your work will only lead to an endless spiral of ZOMGZ WTFs. Try to develop the mechanisms to cope with the stress, do the best job that you can, and that's the best that you can do. You can always improve your effectiveness, but remember that your health and overall well-being is what's most important in the long game. You can only do so much with the time that you have... **and then you die.***

It's not quite as poetically succinct as the someecards version, but a lot more practical. :)
