title: Counter-Striking it up
---

#### I thought I kicked the habit after it ruined my freshman year GPA...

I don't negotiate with terrorists... but if I'm auto-selected to them, I'm gonna set up you the bomb!<!--more--> After many years of only playing Counter-Strike a handful of times, I decided to check it out again and play a round or two. It turns out that I still love the S**T out of the game. It's one of those few things that I'm not too good at but still rather enjoy, much like volleyball. Usually, I get too bummed out about myself when I devote a good amount of time and energy toward something and end up not being too good at it (e.g. guitar(FML.)) but Counter-Strike and volleyball are among the very short list of things that I enjoy so much that it surpasses the hit that my self-esteem takes. :) Honestly, I think I'd be a lot better if I had a team to play with and developed tactics with them and ish. IRL, I mostly just play against expert bots because I like being able to exit out whenever I want/need to.

So a related thing that's happened is that I kind of have become a Twitch.TV lurker, mostly thanks to Counter-Strike. I wanted to watch some tournaments and official teams and see how they play (spoiler: ridiculously) and realized that I could combine two of my passions in life as background noise -- cute girls and Counter-Strike. ^_^;; Some of the streamers are also just plain hilarious. A part of me still doesn't understand how I can watch strangers playing video games, but then again I'm not actually watching them most of the time. I just have it playing in the background while I'm coding or reading articles and ish.

P.S. Your face.
