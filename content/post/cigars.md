#### I smoke cigars! =O

It doesn't quite fit with my personality, and I'm a total amateur, but I enjoy them.<!--more--> Not quite regularly, but I go through phases of my life where I'll smoke a couple a month or so. Over the past 2-3 months I've smoked 4 sticks, mostly [Robustos](http://www.topcubans.com/cuban-cigars/newsize.php?idsize=8) as that's about the right amount for me to enjoy a cigar without getting sick of it. I think I like smoking because I like the sensation of the smoke itself. It's truly unique. *There's nothing like the feeling of thick, warm smoke softly billowing out of your mouth.*

I also enjoy the flavor and character of each unique combination of [wrappers/binders/fillers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cigar#Composition). I tend to like Connecticut wrappers and Nicaraguan fillers. I haven't yet pinpointed a strength that I prefer. I totally want to try some coffee-based varieties too, in particular:
   
   * [Nub Cafe](http://www.cigarsinternational.com/cigars/83764/nub-cafe/) - the Cappuccino ones sound DEEE-LISH. "Smooth and creamy with notes of vanilla bean and notes of cedar."
   * [Java Mint](http://www.cigarsinternational.com/cigars/11403/java-mint-by-drew-estate/) - "A rich, traditional, medium-bodied handmade filled with hints of mocha, coffee, vanilla, and mint..." The wrapper might have a bit more bite than I'd like though...
 
I've kind of wanted to try pipe tobacco too. Smoking really is a strange thing for me to like, but shit, I really enjoy it. I've owned a hookah for years and I break that thing out a lot during the summers. One of the things I always look forward to is sitting around the fire pit after a BBQ, roasting marshmallows and smoking hookah with a bunch of friends. Good times.
