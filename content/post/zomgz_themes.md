#### I want to slap these themes in the face

It reminds me of the experience I had when I was throwing together [the lunch script](http://www.hardtostun.com/lunch) a few years ago. <!--more-->I don't want to dump a bunch of time into pixel-tweaking a GUI from scratch, so I'm ending up spending a ton of time messing around with config files and figuring out random developers' custom themes instead. Not sure I'm winning here, but I'm learning I suppose. At least that's what I'm telling myself...
