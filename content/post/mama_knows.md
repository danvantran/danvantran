#### This is what it would sound like if Jimi Hendrix were produced by Mark Ronson.

Their sound palette is phenomenal.

I think my favorite track of theirs is "Make It Rain". That's got some sick Hendrix-esque riffs.

I saw them in concert for the first time back in Nov. 2014 at the [Fairfield Theatre Company](https://fairfieldtheatre.org/)'s StageOne venue and they are fantastic in person. [Arleigh Kincheloe](http://www.glidemagazine.com/132290/arleigh-kincheloe-sister-sparrow-dirty-birds-interview/) is charismatic and lays down such perfectly raspy vocals, while her bandmates all are amazingly talented with their respective instruments. I was taken aback by the equal distribution of talent across the band. None of them outshined the rest and each held their own during their solos and improvs. Awesome stuff.
