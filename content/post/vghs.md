#### From "Meh." to "Wait. Am I really tearing up right now?? WTF."

[VGHS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_Game_High_School) is a surprisingly good webseries and yes, I did tear up a few times.<!--more--> It started out as a mediocre, sometimes cheezy web series, but then it really did pick up. I found myself getting invested in the characters, and actually caring about the relationships. Even so, I thought that it was only pretty good with some rather impressive special effects until a single episode during season 3 that really touched me.

I've always been a super sentimental person (e.g. I enjoy nearly every romance comedy I've seen, no matter how shitty ahaha). There was an episode that dealt with loss(death of a main character's father) that felt extremely *genuine*, and it totally caught me off-guard. There were some stereotypical aspects to it(there's only so much that you can do given the time constraints and format of the media) but they did a great job of summarizing the internal emotional negotiation that happens when processing grief of that magnitude.

All-in-all, if you're into the gaming culture and you don't mind sitting through some silliness, I recommend checking it out. It's got insane production value given that it's a web series that was funded by a Kickstarter campaign. Getting picked up by Netflix was a big win for them, but after watching the series, I think it's well-deserved.
