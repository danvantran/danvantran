#### I suppose this will do

Not a bad start. Let's take it from here and see how things go. <!--more-->Learning the Go-based templating on top of the modern Javascript library stuff hasn't been too bad, but I'm also fairly certain that I can be doing it better. Still though, not a bad start. I've also hacked together a YouTube/[FitVids.js](http://http://fitvidsjs.com/) [shortcode template](http://gohugo.io/extras/shortcodes/) for Hugo, customized for the current theme I'm using([Casper](https://github.com/vjeantet/hugo-theme-casper)) so that I have a better idea of how things fit together. Guess that's enough for tonight.
