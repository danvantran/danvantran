title: Greenfields are still daunting
---

#### The buffer is so... white

It's a [greenfield project](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenfield_project). I can do anything, and yet I'm struggling to have *something*.<!--more--> I have lots of ideas that would succeed, that is if they were ever actually *realized*. Turning the vision into a reality is the struggle I often face with these projects. The tech stack is foreign. This makes the ideal design difficult to envision. However, I understand the value of just getting shit down so that I can iterate on it, so it's time to just start doing it.

Reflecting on my past projects, both successful and failed, I quickly realized that my strengths are clearly in the area of creative problem-solving and imagination. However, I've also noticed that I often pursue projects in areas that I'm unfamiliar with, and that require a lot of education and growth in order for me to truly develop the skills to implement things, and this often limits my success. Take my pursuits in the area of music composition and remixing. I have an ear for music, and I have all of these ideas for neat songs to write, but I often don't have the necessary skills to actually produce what's in my head. There are some things that work:

   * Originals
      * [Strangled by Fear](http://www.drunkenarts.com/music/Dan_Tran_Strangled_by_Fear.mp3) - title theme for a survival horror game I worked on in college
	  * [Tom and Chris Take On](http://www.drunkenarts.com/music/tom_and_chris_take_on_v2.mp3) - a podcast theme for my friend
   * Remixes
      * [Fireflies(8-bit remix)](http://www.drunkenarts.com/music/Dan%20Tran%20-%20Fireflies.mp3) - I loved working with these sound patches
      * [Xenogears - Dajil (Street Urchin Mix)](http://www.drunkenarts.com/music/DJ_FunkDAT_-_Xenogears_-_Dajil(Street_Urchin_Mix).mp3 - I wanted to experiment with Middle Eastern sound palettes
      * [Jungle Boogie(Dirty Shag Mix)](http://www.drunkenarts.com/music/Dan.Tran_Jungle.Boogie(Dirty.Shag.Mix).Instrumental.mp3 - a random idea I had that worked out

but there are large number of other projects that I would love to pursue but I just don't have the patience to deal with my lack of skills in order to actually complete(or in many cases even start) them. In other words, I don't feel that the time investment to develop the ability to create what I've envisioned is worth it. I've encountered this with my music writing, my guitar playing, my cinematography, etc.

Although I often viewed my jack-of-many-trades-ness as a strength, it's also a curse. It means that for a lot of things, I may be *good* but I will never be *great*, and something within me wants to be great. Right now, I think I've actually stumbled upon something that may motivate me to finally create something magnificent that I can be passionate about pursuing, but first I need to get past this lack-of-skills hurdle. The ideas are exploding inside my head, and I need to commit them to silicon. **WORK WITH ME, GREENFIELD!**
