Skillz. For those of you who don't know, his dad was [Muggsy Bogues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muggsy_Bogues), a 5'3" NBA point guard with a 44" vertical. [original article](http://www.esquire.com/sports/a38271/muggsy-bogues-grandson)<!--more-->

Muggsy Bogues once blocked 7'0" Patrick Ewing. I obviously try to channel him during when I play volleyball. Spoiler: it doesn't work. :'(
