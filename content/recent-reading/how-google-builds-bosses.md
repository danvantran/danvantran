title: How Google Builds Bosses to Order

Spoiler: Lots of internal analytics. [original article](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-google-builds-bosses-order-dr-travis-bradberry) <!--more-->

The best managers multiply their effectiveness through strong leadership principles and communicating core values throughout their team(s). It only makes sense to develop custom training based on what works well in various contexts and to communicate that out further across the various teams so that the organization is self-learning. This would be a great addition to any existing leadership training that already leverages external material.
