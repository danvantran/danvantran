title: MacArthur 'genius' grant winner creates artificial leaves that photosynthesize

And just like nature's version of photosynthesis, it releases oxygen into the air."

I'm excited about what this might mean for space travel, and how it compares to [existing solutions](http://science.howstuffworks.com/oxygen-made-aboard-spacecraft.htm).
