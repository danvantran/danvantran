title: You'll Regret These Choices Forever
---

The title is a bit extreme, but I agree with the gist of the content, which to me is essentially "your reality is how you perceive the things happening to/around you, and that is within your control". [original article](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/worst-decisions-youll-never-make-dr-travis-bradberry)<!--more-->

Although it's difficult to frame things this way when you're in the heat of a moment, I find that it's often helpful to remember that how you perceive things that are happening to you and how you react to them are fully within your power to manage. What you do is both indicative of your character, and helps to determine how content you will be with the specific situation (and ultimately your overall life).

As a side note, I try to live my life without regrets by trying to ensure that every decision I make is genuine to my current needs/desires/knowledge/etc., and that if it leads to a negative outcome, I've learned a lesson to apply toward the future instead of having made a decision that I now regret.
