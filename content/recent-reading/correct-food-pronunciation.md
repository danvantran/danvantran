I don't think that all of these are necessary correct, but these are def the words I get wrong -- almond (ah-mund), bruschetta (broo-sket-ah), and hummus (hoom-us). Bruschetta I get wrong because it sounds pretentious ahaha. [original article](http://the-daily.buzz/correct-food-pronunciation)<!--more-->

One day, I hope to grow up and English good.
