title: Why attitude is more important than IQ
---

This is super obvious stuff, but there are a few gems in in (e.g. Bruce Lee references) :) [original article](http://www.businessinsider.com/why-attitude-is-more-important-than-iq-2015-9)<!--more-->

My favorite bits:

* Warren Buffett's 5/25 technique:

```
5/25 technique: Write down the 25 things you care about the most. Then cross out the bottom 20. The remaining five are your true passions. Everything else is merely a distraction.
```
* References to Bruce Lee's philosophies:

```
Quit and you might as well be dead. If you always put limits on what you can do, physical or anything else, it'll spread over into the rest of your life. It'll spread into your work, into your morality, into your entire being. There are no limits. There are plateaus, but you must not stay there; you must go beyond them. If it kills you, it kills you. A man must constantly exceed his level.
```
