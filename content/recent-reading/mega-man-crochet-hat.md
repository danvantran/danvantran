If you see me on the street wearing this, please save me from the bullies that are beating me up. [original link](http://www.thinkgeek.com/product/ilop/)<!--more-->

I would totally get this if I didn't already have at least three knitted hats already. I'd probably pick [this](http://www.thinkgeek.com/product/1e9c/?srp=8) up too ahaha. That way, I could point it at the bullies and shout "PEW PEW GUNSHOT SOUNDS!". Their laughter will hopefully make the punches softer. :'(
