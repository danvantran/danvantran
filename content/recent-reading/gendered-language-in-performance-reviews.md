title: Stanford University researchers analyzed the language in 125 performance reviews from a tech company and found something disturbing

Nothing revelational but something to keep in mind when trying to evaluate performance in an unbiased way. [original article](http://www.businessinsider.com/gendered-language-in-performance-reviews-2015-10)<!--more-->

My personal approach is to first imagine what a person's contributions would look like if they were performing at their very best and providing the optimal amount of value, then determining why they aren't there and how well they tried to mitigate the obstacles preventing them from performing at their best. I also take into account my personal responsibility for their performing, both positive (e.g. boosting their performance, amount of assistance provided) and negative (e.g. not providing enough support, misguiding them) and factor that in. In my experience, this removes certain factors like gender from the evaluation and provides a more objective critique.
